    # Welcome to Remote Control! ðŸ“±

    This presentation is being controlled remotely.

    The **audience** sees this in the terminal.
    The **presenter** controls it from their phone!

    <!-- Speaker notes: Welcome everyone! Explain that you're controlling this from your phone. The audience can't see these notes. -->

    ---

    # How It Works

    ## For the Audience ðŸ‘¥
    - Clean terminal presentation
    - No distractions
    - Professional appearance

    ## For the Presenter ðŸ“±
    - Mobile web interface
    - **Speaker notes** (like this one!)
    - Slide navigation controls
    - Current slide preview

    <!-- Speaker notes: Point out that you can see these notes on your phone but the audience cannot. This is perfect for conference presentations where WiFi might be unreliable. -->

    ---

    # Features

    âœ… **No WiFi required** - runs on local network
    âœ… **Speaker notes** - visible only to presenter
    âœ… **Mobile friendly** - works on any phone/tablet
    âœ… **Real-time sync** - terminal updates instantly
    âœ… **Clean separation** - audience sees clean slides

    Navigate with your phone to test it out!

    <!-- Speaker notes: Try navigating back and forth to show how responsive it is. The audience will see the slides change in real-time while you control from your phone. -->

    ---

    # Perfect for Conferences ðŸŽ¯

    ## The Problem
    - Conference WiFi is unreliable
    - Need to move around while presenting
    - Want to see speaker notes privately

    ## The Solution
    - Create local hotspot on laptop
    - Connect phone to local network
    - Control presentation remotely
    - **No internet required!**

    <!-- Speaker notes: This solves the classic conference problem of unreliable WiFi. You create your own network between your laptop and phone. -->

    ```elixir
    # Start with remote control
    ElixirNoDeps.RemotePresenter.run("slides.md")

    ElixirNoDeps.RemotePresenter.run("slides.md", web_port: 3000)
    ```

    Then connect your phone to the displayed URL!

    <!-- Speaker notes: Show the audience how simple the API is. The URL will be displayed when you start the presentation. -->

    ---
