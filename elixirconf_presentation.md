# Start Spicy?

## üå∂Ô∏è Spicy Start üå∂Ô∏è

## Modern Software Engineering is broken

![Hot Takes](priv/assets/HotTakes.webp)

<!-- poll:
question: "How do you feel about this spicy take: 'Modern Software Engineering is broken'?"
options:
- "üî• Totally agree - it's a mess!"
- "ü§î Partially true, but not entirely"
- "üò§ Disagree - modern tools are great"
- "üçø Just here for the drama"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
[This is our hook slide - pause here to let the audience take in the title and build anticipation
Wait for full attention before proceeding]

Jerry, should we start this presentation on a spicy note?

Yes we should

Your Kubernetes cluster. Your microservices mesh. Redis. Message queues. Load balancers. Half your monitoring stack.
[Pause]
They're all solving problems that shouldn't exist in the first place."

"For decades, we've scaled by piling on complexity. Microservices to handle load. Containers to manage the services. Meshes to manage the containers. Observability to understand the mesh.
We've built skyscrapers of duct tape‚Ä¶ and called it 'modern software engineering.'"

[Make eye contact, pause after each item for impact]

# There is a better way

## It's been here the whole time

![Elixir Applications](priv/assets/elixir-applications.png)

<!-- poll:
question: "How complex is your current tech stack?"
options:
- "üèóÔ∏è It's a Kubernetes nightmare"
- "üì¶ Docker + microservices maze"
- "üéØ Pretty simple, mostly monolith"
- "ü§∑ What's a tech stack?"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
[THE CONTRAST - Introduce the alternative]
"But what if I told you there's a 30-year-old technology designed from day one to run millions of concurrent processes, self-heal, and scale effortlessly‚Äîwithout the Rube Goldberg machine?"

Use the image to emphasize the complexity we're about to challenge -->

# Spoiler Alert:

## It was Elixir all along

![MIND. BLOWN.](priv/assets/mind-blown.gif)

**Let's explore what's possible with pure Elixir/OTP...**

<!-- poll:
question: "What's your biggest Elixir surprise so far?"
options:
- "ü§Ø It can do THAT much built-in?"
- "‚ö° The performance is incredible"
- "üß† Pattern matching changed my life"
- "üìö Still learning the basics"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:

[1:10-1:35] THE REVELATION - Connect to real-world success
"That technology is Elixir, built on the Erlang VM‚Äîthe same platform behind WhatsApp's billions of messages, Discord's real-time chat, and telecom systems that hit nine nines of uptime.
While we were reinventing the wheel with Docker and Kubernetes, telecom solved this in the 80s."

But first let's (breifly) look at what we can do with "naked" Elixir

-->

# You Can Do A LOT With Just Elixir

## No Dependencies Required

## Built-in SSH Support

![SSH & HTTP](priv/assets/tcp-http-ssh.png)

- **SSH client**: `:ssh` module
- **SSH tunnels**: Port forwarding
- **Key management**: Built-in support
- **No external libraries needed!**

<!-- poll:
question: "How often do you use SSH in your applications?"
options:
- "üöÄ Daily - it's essential"
- "üìÖ Occasionally for deployments"
- "ü§∑ Rarely, mostly for server access"
- "üò± Never thought of using it in apps"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:

This slide demonstrates the first example of built-in capabilities. Emphasize "No external libraries needed!" -->

---

# HTTP Clients & HTTP Servers

## Complete HTTP Stack

![Connecting Platforms](priv/assets/connecting-platforms.png)

- **HTTP client**: `:httpc` module
- **HTTP server**: `:httpd` module
- **SSL/TLS**: Built-in support
- **REST APIs**: Full implementation

<!-- poll:
question: "What's your go-to for HTTP in Elixir?"
options:
- "üöÄ HTTPoison/Finch + Plug/Phoenix"
- "üîß Built-in :httpc and :httpd"
- "üéØ Tesla for clients, Phoenix for servers"
- "ü§î Wait, there are built-in options?"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
Continue building the case for built-in capabilities. This shows HTTP is not just client OR server - it's BOTH.
Emphasize that these are production-ready modules, not toy implementations -->

---

# ETS for Caching

## High-Performance In-Memory Storage

![In-Memory Cache](priv/assets/in-memory-cache-optimized-storage-woman.png)

- **Lightning fast**: Native Erlang tables
- **Atomic operations**: Built-in concurrency
- **Memory efficient**: Optimized storage
- **No Redis required!**

<!-- poll:
question: "What's your caching solution of choice?"
options:
- "‚ö° Redis - the classic"
- "üìä ETS - built into BEAM"
- "üèóÔ∏è Memcached for simplicity"
- "üòÖ What's caching? Just query the DB!"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:

ETS is incredibly powerful - emphasize "No Redis required!" as this often surprises people -->

---

# Persistent Term for Durable Storage

## Fast, Immutable Cache

![State Management](priv/assets/state-management.png)

- **Persistent across restarts**: Built into OTP
- **Immutable by design**: Functional approach
- **Fast access**: Optimized for reads
- **No database needed for simple data!**

<!-- poll:
question: "How do you handle application configuration/state?"
options:
- "üì¶ Environment variables everywhere"
- "üìä Database for all persistent data"
- "üöÄ GenServer state + ETS/Persistent Term"
- "ü§∑ Mix of everything, it's chaos"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
Persistent Term is often overlooked but incredibly useful. This is where you can mention that sometimes you don't need a full database - just fast, durable storage.
"Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution" -->

---

# Escript & Release for Binaries

## Deployable Applications

![Erlang Platform](priv/assets/erlang.png)

- **Escript**: Single-file executables
- **Release**: Production deployments
- **Hot code swapping**: Runtime updates
- **Self-contained**: No external deps

<!-- poll:
question: "How do you deploy your Elixir apps?"
options:
- "üöÄ Elixir releases (mix release)"
- "üì¶ Docker containers"
- "‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud platforms (Fly.io, Gigalixir, etc.)"
- "üòÖ What's deployment? It works on my machine!"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
[1:35-1:50] THE PROMISE - Set up what's coming
"Today, I'll show you why Elixir isn't just another language‚Äîit's a paradigm shift that can replace your entire backend architecture.
Sometimes, the future means going back to fundamentals that actually work."

And to package up all your source code, we have two powerful tools: escript and releases.
(runtime included!)
The "packaged" files are self contained and have everything they need to run themselves.
Docker not required!

This slide shows deployment capabilities. Emphasize "Self-contained" - no Docker needed! -->

# But What If You DO Need Dependencies?

## We Need to Evaluate Tradeoffs

![Elixir Jar](priv/assets/elixir_jar.png)

**Let's have an honest conversation about dependency management...**

<!-- poll:
question: "How do you evaluate adding a new dependency?"
options:
- "üìä Look at GitHub stars and download counts"
- "üîç Deep dive: code quality, maintenance, tests"
- "‚è±Ô∏è If it saves time, add it immediately"
- "üòÖ YOLO - just mix deps.get and pray"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:

Transition slide - acknowledge that dependencies aren't always bad, but we need to be smarter about them.
This is where we pivot from "built-in is great" to "dependencies need evaluation" -->

---

# The Reality of Dependencies

## Active Support Questions

- **Is it actively maintained?**
- **Repo abandonment/orphanage is real**
- **Fewer open source contributors**
- **Time pressure and social issues**

## Corporate Sponsorship

- **Is there corporate backing?**
- **Long-term viability assessment**
- **Community health indicators**

<!-- poll:
question: "What's your biggest concern with dependencies?"
options:
- "üò± Abandoned/unmaintained packages"
- "üîí Security vulnerabilities"
- "üèóÔ∏è Breaking changes in updates"
- "üìè Too many transitive dependencies"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:

You have to look at every dependency critically.

The "repo abandonment/orphanage" point is crucial - this is happening across the industry.

Emphasize that corporate sponsorship isn't always bad - it can mean long-term stability

 -->

---

# The Dependency Dilemma

## Traditional Engineering Approach

- **Senior engineer consultation required**
- **Tradeoff evaluation meetings**
- **Risk assessment processes**
- **Time-consuming decision making**

## Modern Reality

- **Faster development cycles needed**
- **More complex dependency graphs**
- **Supply chain security concerns**

<!-- poll:
question: "How are dependency decisions made at your company?"
options:
- "üë• Team discussion and consensus"
- "üíº Senior engineer/architect approval"
- "üèÉ Individual developer choice"
- "ü§∑ No formal process, it just happens"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
Contrast the old way (slow, bureaucratic) with the new reality (fast, complex, insecure).
This sets up the need for a new approach to dependency management -->

---

# Handling Under-Supported Repos

## The Fork Question

- **Do you fork everything?**
- **Is that better for you?**
- **Maintenance burden transfer**
- **What if you only need ‚Öì of functionality?**

## The 80/20 Rule

- **Most libraries are over-engineered**
- **You often need just the core features**
- **The rest adds complexity without value**

<!-- poll:
question: "When a library becomes unmaintained, you:"
options:
- "üî± Fork it and maintain your own version"
- "üöÄ Find an actively maintained alternative"
- "‚úèÔ∏è Copy the code you need into your project"
- "üòÖ Keep using it and hope for the best"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:

What if the repo is just gathering dust? Open issues? Unmerged trivail pull requests?
And what if you only need 20% of the functionality in the repo?

The 80/20 rule is key here - most people only use a small fraction of what libraries provide.
"What if you only need ‚Öì of functionality?" - this often resonates with developers -->

---

# Libraries: Encapsulation vs. Obfuscation

## The Tradeoff

- **Encapsulation**: Namespacing
- **Obfuscation**: Hiding what's happening**
- **Transparency**: See the code you're using
- **Control**: Understand your dependencies

## Not Every Library is Unnecessary

- **Postgrex**: Very specific, complex problem
- **Ecto**: Modular database abstraction
- **But could you write SQL directly?**

<!-- poll:
question: "Do you prefer libraries that:"
options:
- "üé© Hide complexity (magic functions)"
- "üîç Show you exactly what's happening"
- "‚öñÔ∏è Balance of both depending on use case"
- "ü§∑ I don't think about it much"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
"Well a library is both encapsulation and obfuscation. Not to suggest that every library is unnecessary.
Some are very specific or solve a complex problem in a modular fashion, for example postgrex.
But could you write an app with DB access and not use Ecto? Only write SQL? Maybe. It's something to consider."

This shows we're not being dogmatic - some libraries are genuinely valuable -->

---

# The Orphanage Problem

## Repo Abandonment Reality

- **Timex author largely moved on from Elixir**
- **Fewer open source contributors**
- **More disincentive to contribute**
- **Time pressure and social issues**

## Across Software Engineering

- **Not just an Elixir problem**
- **Industry-wide trend**
- **Corporate consolidation impact**

<!-- poll:
question: "Have you experienced using an abandoned/orphaned package?"
options:
- "üò± Yes, and it broke our production"
- "üòü Yes, but we managed to work around it"
- "üòÖ Not yet, but I'm worried about it"
- "üçÄ Nope, we're lucky so far"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:

Aside: "The Orphanage Problem" sounds like a darker version of the Trolley Experiment

[This is the harsh reality check.]

"Timex solved such a vital problem and it did it so well that it is now a pervasive transient dependency.
And that is unfortunate since the author, as I understand it, has largely moved on from Elixir.hh
Repo abandonment/orphanage is a real issue. Not just in Elixir, but across software engineering. There are fewer open source contributors. There is more disincentive to actually contribute due to both time pressure and social issues‚Ä¶"

Who here has seen, participated in, or been the unfortunate focus of a viral Github issue?

Make this personal - this affects everyone in the room -->

# üå∂Ô∏è Modern Problems, Modern Solutions

## Copy the Source Directly

![Elixir Evolution](priv/assets/jarvis.jpg)

**Use an LLM to import dependency code into your codebase**

## This is the part where we make you mad

- **Selective inclusion**: Only what you need
- **Full control**: No external dependencies
- **Customization**: Adapt to your use case
- **Transparency**: See exactly what you're using

<!-- poll:
question: "Using LLMs to copy/adapt open source code into your project:"
options:
- "üî• Brilliant! Modern problems need modern solutions"
- "ü§î Interesting but I have concerns"
- "üò± Absolutely not! That's wrong"
- "üçø Already doing this, glad someone said it"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
üå∂Ô∏è SPICY TAKE INCOMING - This is the controversial but practical solution
"Now there is an easier way. Use an LLM and import the dependency code directly into your codebase."

This is where you'll get some reactions - lean into it! -->

---

# Historical Precedent: Timex & Distillery

## Core Problems ‚Üí Core Solutions

![Elixir Evolution](priv/assets/elixir-applications.png)

**Both solved core problems that were unhandled by Elixir in the v0 days**

- **Timex**: Date/time functionality gradually migrated to core
- **Distillery**: Release management became built-in
- **Pattern**: Community libraries ‚Üí Core features

<!-- poll:
question: "Have you used Timex or Distillery in past projects?"
options:
- "‚è∞ Yes, Timex was essential for date/time"
- "üì¶ Yes, Distillery for releases before mix release"
- "üëè Both! They were game-changers"
- "üÜï Neither, joined Elixir after they were needed"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
This provides historical context and shows this isn't a new idea.
"Both solved core problems that were unhandled by Elixir in the v0 days" - this legitimizes the approach -->

---

# The Old Paradigm is Dead

## Writing and Maintaining Code

- **Traditional approach**: Write everything from scratch
- **Modern reality**: Leverage existing solutions
- **LLM assistance**: Intelligent code adaptation
- **Selective inclusion**: Only what you need

## Elixir Core Principle

**"Be explicit"** - Have your code tell you what it does

<!-- poll:
question: "What's your preferred development approach?"
options:
- "üöÄ Ship fast, optimize later"
- "üìú Write explicit, understandable code"
- "ü§ñ Leverage AI/LLMs to accelerate development"
- "‚öñÔ∏è Balance of all approaches"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
"The old paradigm of writing and maintaining code is dead and dying. Embrace the tools at hand. 
Libraries/ deps are one way to manage the fact that it is too time consuming to reimplement
the same bit of functionality in every codebase.
But now we are less constrained by the time it takes the write the code.
And as a side effect you get code visibility and explicitness (for free)

One of the core principals of Elixir is: Be explicit. Have your code tell you what it does. Don't rely on indirection or magic."

[Connect this back to Elixir's philosophy] -->

---

# Deployment Complexity

## Modern App Deployment is Too Complex

![State Management](priv/assets/state-management.png)

**Too many layers, too much complexity**

- **Your app can do most things**
- **Additional layers often unnecessary**
- **Kubernetes is frankly insane**
- **Almost no one should use K8s**

<!-- poll:
question: "What's your current deployment strategy?"
options:
- "üèóÔ∏è Kubernetes (because everyone else does it)"
- "üì¶ Docker containers on cloud platforms"
- "üöÄ Simple VPS with systemd/releases"
- "üòÖ FTP to shared hosting (don't judge me)"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
Callback to the original point about complexity in apps and deployments.
"Modern app deployment is too complex. There are too many layers. And the app you write can do most of the things that you are relying on additional layers to handle."

This is where you can be more direct: "Kubernetes is frankly insane. Almost no one should use K8s." -->

---

# Scale Vertically First

## The Elixir Way

![Erlang Platform](priv/assets/erlang.png)

- **Deploy to a single server first**
- **Scale vertically**: More CPUs/Memory/Resources
- **Only scale horizontally when needed**
- **Application clustering built into BEAM by default**

## Don't Add Complexity Until You Need It

- **Start simple**
- **Grow organically**
- **Avoid premature optimization**

<!-- poll:
question: "When do you typically start thinking about scaling?"
options:
- "üòÖ Day 1 - gotta be ready for viral success!"
- "üìä When performance metrics show bottlenecks"
- "üí∏ When we actually have money to spend on it"
- "üò± When the server catches fire"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
"Deploy your elixir code to a single server. Don't add anything else until you need to.
Scale the node vertically first (more CPUs/Memory/Resources). Only scale horizontally when you need to.
Don't forget that application clustering is built into the BEAM by default. It's largely due to the modern abstraction monstrosity that is deployment orchestration (K8s) that you even need a library to manage your elixir clusters in the first place."

This is the key insight - BEAM already handles clustering -->

# Run From Your Laptop

## Minimum Viable Deployment

![Connecting Platforms](priv/assets/connecting-platforms.png)

**You should be able to run your whole application from your laptop**

- **Without duplicating multi-service deployment locally**
- **Single-node operation**
- **Unless your company name rhymes with Frugal or Feta**

<!-- poll:
question: "Can you run your entire application stack locally?"
options:
- "‚úÖ Yes - single command and everything works"
- "üîÑ Mostly - need a few external services"
- "üòÖ Sort of - requires 47 Docker containers"
- "üò± No way - too many microservices"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
"At a minimum you should be able to run your whole application from your laptop. (without duplicating all of a multi-service deployment locally)"

The "Frugal or Feta" line is a joke about Google/Meta - use it to lighten the mood -->

# Final Thoughts

**"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication -- Leonardo da Vinci (apocryphal)"**

**"Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains -- Steve Jobs"**

**"Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability -- Edsger W. Dijkstra"**

ElixirNoDeps proves that powerful tools don't need complex dependencies.

**Modern problems require modern solutions.**

**Thank you for your attention!**

<!-- poll:
question: "What's your next step after leaving this talk?"
options:
- "‚òï Coffee break and process everything"
- "üìù Take notes and plan changes"

- "üöÄ Go build something awesome!"
-->

<!-- Speaker notes:
End with the quote: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"
This ties everything together - you're advocating for simplicity in a complex world.
"Modern problems require modern solutions" - this justifies the LLM approach.
End with confidence and gratitude -->
